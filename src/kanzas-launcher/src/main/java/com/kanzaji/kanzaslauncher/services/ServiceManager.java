 * <h1>ServiceManager</h1>
 * ServiceManager is a class used to hold and manage Services.
 * All services have 3 phases of initialization, Exiting phase and Crash phase. None of those are required to be implemented.
 * <br>
 * <h3>Order of Operations:</h3>
 * <li><b>PRE_INIT</b> - Instantly after the app is launched, should be used for only crucial initialization that needs to be done as fast as possible.</li>
 * <li><b>INIT</b> - Launched soon after PRE_INIT. Some crucial code might get executed between those two phases.</li>
 * <li><b>POST_INIT</b> - Should be used for stuff required to do after initialization of the app.</li>
 * <li><b>EXIT</b> - Launched on exit of the app.</li>
 * <li><b>CRASH</b> - Launched on the crash of the app, if any special handling in services is required.</li>
